Welcome to the <b>ferite.org</b> website. <b>ferite</b> is a scripting engine 
and language written in c for complete portability. For more information please 
see the <a href="about.html">about</a> page. The current version is <b>1.1.19</b>.<br>

<h3>quick example:</h3>
ferite is a clean language with influences from various places: objects from 
Java/C++, functions from C/php, closures from scheme, block calling from ruby,
namespaces from C++,  as well as its own a sane loose typing mechanism, 
variant type and set of nice APIs. Here is an example:<br>
<br>
<TABLE cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 WIDTH="90%" align=center><TR><TD class=staticrow>
<pre>      <b>uses</b> "console";
      Console.println( "Hello World" );
</pre>
</TD></TR></TABLE><Br>
<br>
This is the famous "Hello World" program in ferite, to see more examples have a
look at <a href="examples.html">this
example page</a>. To view the scripts click on the version number. ferite
features a wealth of features including explicit global variables,
namespaces, normal functions, exception handling, perl like regular
expressions, variable argument lists, plus all sorts of other goodies
to provide a pleasant programming experience.
