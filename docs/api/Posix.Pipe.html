<h2>class Pipe</h2>

<p>This class provides a means for talking to a forked child process </p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>An instance of this class has two variables, in and out, which are both instances of the Stream.StdioStream class. Data written into the in stream comes out of the out stream. The converse is not true- pipes are one way only. Pipes are typically used for forked child processes to communicate with their parents or vice versa. After creating a pipe and forking, one process should become the reader and the other should become the writer, and each process should call the close() method on the end which it is not using.     </p>
